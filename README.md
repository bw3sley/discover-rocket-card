## 💻 About this project

This project proposal was to develop a border generator to the card, as a increment I fetched the [Github's API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to bring dynamic data to it. It's a **challenge** provided by the [Rocketseat's Discover trail](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/discover).

I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

And you can use this project as you wish!
